### Installation

To install just the theme execute the following:
```zsh
zsh -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keith-gamble/zsh-theme/master/install.sh)" && source ~/.zshrc
```

If you want to also install the `.zshrc` file I have included for some convenience functions, then add the following flag:
```zsh
zsh -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keith-gamble/zsh-theme/master/install-with-zshrc.sh)" && source ~/.zshrc
```

If you installed the compatible `.zshrc` file then after installation, to update the theme execute the following:
```zsh
zsh-update
```
